# New-Perspectives
Exploration in Monocular Depth Images at MIT with Object Based Media.

New Perspectives, looks at stereograpic photos and effects. Images that acquire a depth information are typically made from a pair of stereo images or from infrared lasers(i.e. LIDAR). While most phones currently do not include a lidar sensor or a stereo camera, getting depth photos could be possible in a monocular setup. 
	
New Perspectives uses images from camera moving in a swift linear motion at high shutter speeds. The images are analyzed and compared for varying disparity. Depending on the disparity captured the image produces it will compute a depth map specifically for said image with another image quickly taken at some distance from the original. Cameras used in this project were the Nishika N8000 camera and my Smartphone camera. The project origianlly began in MATLAB, but was primarily done in OPEN CV.
